# Night-Sky-Temple-Checklist
I don't play to complete Night Sky Temple quickly, but I often fish or catch insects, so it would be useful to have a list of what I'm missing. This project was created to make my life easier, but I hope it will also help others.

If you have any ideas or problems, create an issue.
